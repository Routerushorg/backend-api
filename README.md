    <h1>Route Rush API</h1>
    <p>This project is a backend application designed to manage user authentication and API services. It leverages Firebase for authentication and Hapi.js as the server framework. The application provides essential functionalities such as user registration, login, and logout, making it a suitable starting point for projects requiring secure user management.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the project is containerized using Docker, ensuring ease of deployment and scalability. The codebase follows a modular structure to separate concerns and improve maintainability, making it simple to extend or modify as needed.</p>

    <p>To run the application, environment variables are utilized to secure sensitive information like Firebase credentials, and all dependencies are installed automatically during the setup process. The API can be accessed locally or deployed to a server environment for production use.</p>
